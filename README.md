 📁 Folder Structure
- `java-code/` – Contains Java source code (`InventoryApp.java`)
- `sql/` – SQL file to create the database and products table (`inventory_db.sql`)
- `powerbi/` – Contains Power BI report file (`SalesDashboard.pbix`)
- `README.md` – This file
- `project-summary.txt` – Quick summary for interviews

---

📌 Features
- Add product: ID, name, quantity, and price
- View all product records in a table format
- Connect Power BI to MySQL to visualize:
  - Product vs Quantity (Bar Chart)
  - Total stock value (Card)
  - Complete product list (Table)

---

▶️ How to Run

1. SQL Setup
- Import `inventory_db.sql` into MySQL Workbench or any SQL client

2. Java App
- Open `InventoryApp.java` in Eclipse/IntelliJ
- Add JDBC driver to your project
- Replace `your_password` in code with your MySQL password
- Run the code to insert/view products

3. Power BI Dashboard
- Open `SalesDashboard.pbix` in Power BI Desktop
- Connect to MySQL database `inventory_db`
- Load `products` table to generate visuals
