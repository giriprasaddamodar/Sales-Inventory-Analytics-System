üí° Project Description
This is a beginner-friendly project that simulates a simple inventory tracker system. It allows users to add and view product data using a Java console application, stores data in a MySQL database, and displays visual insights using Power BI.

---

 üìÅ Folder Structure
- `java-code/` ‚Äì Contains Java source code (`InventoryApp.java`)
- `sql/` ‚Äì SQL file to create the database and products table (`inventory_db.sql`)
- `powerbi/` ‚Äì Contains Power BI report file (`SalesDashboard.pbix`)
- `README.md` ‚Äì This file
- `project-summary.txt` ‚Äì Quick summary for interviews

---

üìå Features
- Add product: ID, name, quantity, and price
- View all product records in a table format
- Connect Power BI to MySQL to visualize:
  - Product vs Quantity (Bar Chart)
  - Total stock value (Card)
  - Complete product list (Table)

---

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. SQL Setup
- Import `inventory_db.sql` into MySQL Workbench or any SQL client

2. Java App
- Open `InventoryApp.java` in Eclipse/IntelliJ
- Add JDBC driver to your project
- Replace `your_password` in code with your MySQL password
- Run the code to insert/view products

3. Power BI Dashboard
- Open `SalesDashboard.pbix` in Power BI Desktop
- Connect to MySQL database `inventory_db`
- Load `products` table to generate visuals

---

Power BI Visuals
- üìà Bar Chart ‚Äì Product vs Quantity
- üí≥ Card ‚Äì Total stock value (DAX)
- üìã Table ‚Äì All product details
