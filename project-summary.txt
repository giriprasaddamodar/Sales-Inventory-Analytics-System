📄 Project Summary: Sales & Inventory Tracker

---

🎯 Objective:
To create a simple inventory management system using Java for logic, MySQL for data storage, and Power BI for business visualization.

---

🛠️ Technologies Used:
- Java (Console application)
- MySQL (Database)
- JDBC (Connection between Java and DB)
- Power BI (Dashboards and charts)

---

🧩 Key Features:
- Add new products with ID, name, quantity, and price
- View product list from MySQL table
- Power BI connects directly to DB to visualize data

---

🗂️ How It Works:
1. Java program runs in terminal
2. You can enter product details (add/view)
3. Data is stored in `products` table in MySQL
4. Power BI fetches and shows the data using:
   - Bar chart (stock levels)
   - Card (total stock value)
   - Table (product-wise details)

💬 Keywords to Use in Interview:
- "Java console app"
- "JDBC connection"
- "SQL insert and select queries"
- "Power BI dashboards"
- "CRUD operations"
- "Beginner-level data handling"

🧠 Interview Answer (Short):
“I built a basic inventory app using Java and stored the data in MySQL using JDBC. Then I used Power BI to visualize it — like showing which product has the highest stock. It helped me understand full-stack data flow from code to dashboard.”
